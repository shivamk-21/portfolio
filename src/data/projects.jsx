      description:
        "The current world demands for Rapid Prototyping and Deployment. Conventional Manufacturing is not fast enough and require tasks like manufacturing, assembly and finishing. 3D Printing eliminates these tasks. But, 3D Printing is prone to various errors thus its monitoring is essential. By Recording vibrations produced in the printer and then using Machine Learning Models we can predict if error is produced or not.",
